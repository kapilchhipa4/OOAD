/*

    Inverting the design where lower level modules defining interface that
    higher level modules depend on.

    So we get: higher level modules which define interfaces that lower
    level modules implement.

    High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    Abstraction should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon
    abstractions.
